Add Patch Notes
Remove Skipping Months. Too buggy and allows players to go too quickly.
Add more random events, since they are very repetitive at the moment
Make it so some events can’t repeat
Add more countries
MANAGER MODE
Add an avatar creator (doesn’t have to be good)
Make mini displays of matches
Remove GK
Improve events logic; Some events shouldn't be displayed if the player is past a certain OVR. For example, No "Emergency Loan Offer" if you're the best player at the club.
Events shouldn't tell you what the outcome of the different choices are until after you choose them.
Add something akin to the "Needs" meters from BitLife, where you need to balance your happiness, fitness, health and stress.
Morale system: a hidden 1-100 morale bar affected by events, which influences match selection and performance
Rivalry system : specific opponent clubs that generate unique pre-match events
Youth academy product: occasionally a player you mentored makes the first team, earning you a loyalty bonus
Physio progress bar during ACL rehab showing month-by-month recovery with mini-decisions
Transfer negotiation mini-game: counter-offer, hold out, or accept, with agents involved
Club loyalty badges: earn perks for staying 3+ seasons (guaranteed starts, testimonial)
Press conference system: monthly questions that affect team morale or personal brand
Weather system: pitch conditions that modify match outcomes (frozen pitch = lower scoring, wet = more errors)
Contract release clause: let the player set one, which then triggers offers when OVR crosses a threshold
