all casino games fixed but scratchcard;  doesnt load anymore.

League STILL resets upon transferring. Might be better to save the state of the league each day progression.

Money display at the top doesn't update reliably. Have to refresh page to update counter.

Some events should only show when certain conditions are met e.g. "Cleared 10 days early" event should happen only when the player has an injury longer than 10 days 
or "starting player out, you get 3 week guaranteed in the XI" should not appear if you are already in the starting XI (if your at a certain standing with the manager)

Next Fixture display still always off by 2 days.

Call this new version, Version 8, and increase by 1 for each subsequent set of changes to the game
